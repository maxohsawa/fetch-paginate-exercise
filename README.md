# Fetch and Pagination Exercise

### Description
This exercise demonstrates using Axios to fetch data from what would be an external API for dog facts and efficiently render article links using React useEffect. This exercise also includes some logic for paginating the links. A problem occurred when trying to use an external API which was that the browser blocks "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" due to CORS policy. For this reason, I pre-loaded the JSON data from the API and used a local copy.

### How to Run
Currently there is no live demo. It can be run locally with npm http-server and relies on React, Babel, and Bootstrap CDNs.

### Roadmap of Future Improvements
May add features such as more styling.
